NGS best practise is an effort to create a community-maintained collection of NGS workflows and best practice guidelines. As this is a fast-moving area with a wide range of available tools, we hope to help both beginners first entering the field, and more experienced bioinformaticians looking for a quick overview of a particular area and the available tools within it. 

## About the team

This webpage was first created as part of the [TGAC](http://www.tgac.ac.uk/) workshop on science reproducibility, by Richard Smith-Una, Jelena Aleksic, Martin Dahl√∂, Catherine Shang and Luis Pedro Coelho, inspired by discussions emerging from the workshop.
