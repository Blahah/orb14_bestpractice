## Introduction

The purpose of the project is to provide bioinformaticians and those new to the field with easy to follow tutorial style overviews of standard bioinformatics workflows. We believe that by making best practices more accessible, the quality of analysis performed by the field as a whole can improve. 

All the pages are stored on GitHub, and we encourage anyone to join and contribute to the materials. 

## Editing an existing workflow

In order to edit an existing workflow, you should fork the repo, and send in a pull request with changes. 

If you are editing the standard steps of an existing analysis, please provide information within the page about why the change is an improvement in protocol. For example, explain any parameters changed, or compare the new tool being introduced with existing ones. 

## Contributing a new workflow

Please contribute any new workflows as GitHub pages. The workflow will be reviewed by the admins, and if it is found to follow best practices, will be added to the website.
