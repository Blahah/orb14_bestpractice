## Editing an existing workflow

In order to edit an existing workflow, you should fork the repo, and send in a pull request with changes.

If you are editing the standard steps of an existing analysis, please provide information within the page about why the change is an improvement in protocol. For example, explain any parameters changed, or compare the new tool being introduced with existing ones.
