## Overview

This page gives guidelines and tutorials for different components of an RNA-seq transcript expression analysis. To get straight into the analysis, follow one of the compatible workflows, or to learn more about the best practices for each step, have a look at the guides below.

## Data

<div class="alert-message block-message info">
  <a class="close" href="#">×</a>
  <p>It is crucial to document the way data was generated, and to report this when archiving your data and in publication.</p>
</div>

### Steps

How to collect the data. Why each thing is imporant.

### Reporting
=======

You **must** record:

- Experiment metadata as described at the [SRA/ENA](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/submit/read-submission)
- RNA extraction protocol
- Fragmentation protocol
- Sequencing chemistry and protocol
- Adapter and primer sequences
- Whether the reads are paired-end
- Read size
- Insert size distribution parameters:
  - mean
  - standard deviation

You **should** record:

- Some thing
- Some other thing

#### Explanation

(why each thing is important - what downstream steps does it contribute to, or why is it crucial for reproducibility)

See: [Sample metadata file template]()

## QC

<div class="alert-message block-message info">
  <a class="close" href="#">×</a>
  <p>All current sequencing technology is inherently error-prone, and mistakes or problems in the sequencing process can lead to problems in downstream analysis if they are not detected. It is crucial to examine the reads using quality control software to identify potential problems.</p>
</div>

### Steps

You *must*:

- **either** remove adapter sequences from your reads **or** remove reads that contain adapter sequences
- **either** remove reads with low quality **or** trim low quality bases from reads
- remove reads with a high proportion of ambiguous bases
