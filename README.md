# NGS Best Practice

## Introduction

The purpose of the project is to provide biologists and bioinformaticians new to the field with a single resource to find out about best practice for common high-throughput approaches.

In particular, we provide:

the steps considered necessary in a particular kind of analysis
the current knowledge about theoretical considerations for each step, with references
minimum standards for describing the analysis
We believe that by making best practices more accessible, the quality of analysis performed by the field as a whole can improve.

All the pages are stored on GitHub, and we encourage anyone to join and contribute to the materials.
